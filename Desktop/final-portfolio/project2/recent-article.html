                <h2>MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study</h2>

                <h2>What is PTSD?</h2>
                <p>PTSD is a common and debilitating condition with immeasurable social and economic costs that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people annually. There are a number of environmental and biological risk factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of PTSD1, and poor PTSD treatment outcomes are associated with several comorbid conditions that include childhood trauma2, alcohol and substance use disorders3, depression4, suicidal ideation5 and dissociation6. It is therefore imperative to identify a therapeutic that is beneficial in those individuals with the comorbidities that typically confer treatment resistance.</p>

                <h2 id="demographics"> Demographics and baseline characteristics</h2>
                
                <h3>Race</h3>
                <p>The study had a total of 90 participants. The participants were divided in two groups. those who had MDMA assisted therapy and those on a placebo session. </p>
                
                <p> One of the several limitations in gathering participats was due to the coronavirus disease pandemic. The population therefore lacks racial and ethic diversity. </p>

                <h3 id="benefits">Prior Therapy</h3>
                <p>Prior to taking MDMA assited therapy, many had taken a combination of different therapy styles. </p>
                <p>Further on in the article we are able to read that MDMA therapy was effective in the reduction of depression symptons. Overall, three dose of MDMA given in conjunction with therapy over 18 weeks results in the reduction of PTSD symptons and function impairments.</p>

                <h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
                <p>In summary, MDMA-assisted therapy induces rapid onset of 
                    treatment efficacy, even in those with severe PTSD, and in those 
                    with associated comorbidities including dissociative PTSD, depression, history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood 
                    trauma. Not only is MDMA-assisted therapy efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, but it may also provide improved patient 
                    safety. Compared with current first-line pharmacological and 
                    behavioral therapies, MDMA-assisted therapy has the potential to 
                    dramatically transform treatment for PTSD and should be expeditiously evaluated for clinical use.</p>
