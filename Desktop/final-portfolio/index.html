                <p>Summer is quickly approaching and outdoor dining might still be something many New Yorkers will like to enjoy. My exploratory data will read as a “blog”, for New Yorkers or visitors to explore the restaurants that are re-opening. The data being used is from the NYC Open Data, which is being collected from restaurants who are filing the application form for authorization to reopen or having outdoor seating.

                <h2>MDMA Therapy Article</h2>
                <p>There are many different styles of therapy in 2021 and there will soon be a new assisted therapy that can help millions! MDMA assisted therapy is said to reduce fear in when reliving traumatic events. This new form of therapy has been going through several phases and its finally concluding its final phases to seek approval by the FDA and be approved for clinical practice. You can read this article with the link below. What I did wit this article is try to make it more digestible and grouped information from one table with supporting text that was scattered in different sections of the article.</p>

                    <p>Article:<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3.epdf?sharing_token=TIoaoU5K3OhwJwB3Do6yD9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MwTNUpKxqtvF0w43JP2V-60wA_XzXR9rPcHUDquhUlnwsHoHT11tJIvYYJkqbzAVI_LC3oirm2U7gkA2t9m8KXNIYa9nKDiJw-lGrkTA8aD3BHLNABZKqEveAmlZmYcx8%3D"> MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study </a>
                    </p>
                <h4>Reflection: May 2021</h4>

                <p>Drawing the data visualizations helped me understand thoroughly how d3.js calls functions and the libraries it has to make data grouping convenient. For the MDMA article, I focused on reformatting a simple table that was included in the published article. This table was long and in my opinion makes you lose focus with the amount of information it contains. I decided to focus on two groups that went along with what the article was talking about, which was the lack of diversity and comparing the different types of therapy with MDMA therapy. </p>

                    <p>The design process for the MDMA article was a bit more challenging than the “Bronx restaurant” project because I had to use the table to build mini data sets. I had to structure the file based on the graph I would use and also make sure I am inserting and representing the data accurately. On the other hand for the Bronx Restaurant project. I was able to download a filtered version using the OPEN DATA NYC platform.</p>
                    
                   <p> The design process is very structured and the only thing I would do more next time is sketch more. The part of ideation that helped most was folding the paper into sections to think of different ways I can visualize the same data. </p>
                    
                   <p>For my visuals one of the things I focus most is color pattern and consistency. I did not want too much color stimulation, although it might have helped to add more color to some of my visuals. I focused on keeping the format clean. I also focused on making the pages easy to navigate and flow. When I was picking the graphs, I really wanted to use a pie chart, but stumbled upon an article that explained why pie charts should be avoided. The brief reasoning explained as to why pie charts might not be a good idea to represent data is that most people cannot measure angles and therefore it could leave data to be misrepresented. </p>
                    
                   <p> One of the most helpful things I learned from my projects is that you can tell many stories with one visual. As a consumer of social media, when I see a post of a graph or numbers being attached to a story there seems to be an inherent trust to the credibility of an article I have yet to open,but knowing the mistakes that can happen when it comes to representing data has opened my eyes to be more skeptical. The benefit of reading a scientific research paper for this project is that it provides all the numbers and how they got those numbers. The article explains the software test that was done and provides information as to possible biases. </p>
                    
                   <p>If I had more time and resources I would reach out to the  authors of the article to be able to get part of the data. This would also help replicate some of the graphs that are in the article that I think are really well thought out.</p>
                    
                   <p> Post Corona: I would want to work with teammates to be able to understand further how they approached certain problems and why they picked the visuals they did to represent their data. Slack was very helpful and my classmates were as active as they could. </p>
